0.2

   2005-07-05        Release 0.2.1.

                     Fixed a DNS resolution bug related to Twisted 2.0 upgrade.

   2005-02-17        Release 0.2.0.

   2005-02-15        Announce 0.2.0rc1.

                     Tooltip username labels for the map window are now more
                     visible on OS X.

                     Most wxStaticTextBox instances have been replaced with
                     simple labels.

   2005-02-14        Server will permit clients to disconnect during gameplay
                     and then rejoin the game.  Server saves game data to a
                     database, so it can be shut down and restarted without
                     loss of game state.

                     Clients receive pop-up notification when a player leaves,
                     rejoins, etc.

                     Clients can send chat messages "to all" or "to team".

   2005-02-12        Completed rewrite of all networking code, using the
                     event-driven Twisted framework.  Protocol is now line-based.  
                     Server supports multiple simultaneous games.  Thanks to
                     Conor Davis <conor at fastmail dot fm> for significant 
                     contributions to server code.

                     Client game registration windows now use the more
                     suitable wxListCtrl.
